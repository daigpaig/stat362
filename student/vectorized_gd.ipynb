    "- **Reduced Bugs**: Fewer loops mean fewer opportunities for indexing errors\n",
    "- **Mathematical Clarity**: Code structure mirrors mathematical notation more closely\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Easier to read, understand, and modify vectorized implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel Processing Power**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-core CPUs**: Automatic distribution across available CPU cores\n",
    "- **GPU Acceleration**: Seamless utilization of thousands of GPU cores for massive parallelism\n",
    "- **Distributed Computing**: Efficient scaling across multiple machines\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Fundamentals\n",
    "Matrices are two-dimensional arrays where all elements are of the same data type. They form the backbone of linear algebra operations in machine learning and are essential for efficient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Notation and Conventions\n",
    "- **Matrix Notation**: Matrices are denoted with capital, bold letters such as $\\mathbf{X}$, $\\mathbf{W}$, $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "- **Dimensions**: \n",
    "  - $m$ = number of rows (typically represents number of training examples)\n",
    "  - $n$ = number of columns (typically represents number of features)\n",
    "  - Matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Matrix with Bias Term\n",
    "In machine learning, we often augment our feature matrix to include a bias term. The bias $b$ is incorporated as the **first column** of the matrix, consisting of all ones. This allows us to combine the bias and weights into a single matrix operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{augmented}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(1)} & x_2^{(1)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(1)} \\\\\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(2)} & x_2^{(2)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(2)} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(m)} & x_2^{(m)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(m)}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times (n+1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of Bias Integration:**\n",
    "- **Simplified Computation**: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{augmented}} \\mathbf{w}$ instead of $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w} + b$\n",
    "- **Vectorized Operations**: All parameters (weights + bias) updated simultaneously\n",
    "- **Cleaner Implementation**: Reduces code complexity and potential for errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Element Indexing\n",
    "- **Superscript notation**: $x^{(i)}$ refers to the $i^{th}$ training example\n",
    "- **Subscript notation**: $x_j^{(i)}$ refers to the $j^{th}$ feature of the $i^{th}$ training example\n",
    "- **Python indexing**: Remember that NumPy uses 0-based indexing (first element is index 0)"

    "- Cleaner, more readable syntax that mirrors mathematical notation\n",
    "- Specifically designed for matrix multiplication\n",
    "- **Recommended for new code**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `np.matmul()` - The Explicit Matrix Multiplication**\n",
    "- Explicitly designed for matrix multiplication\n",
    "- Similar to `@` operator (in fact, `@` calls `matmul` internally)\n",
    "- Useful when you want to emphasize that you're doing matrix multiplication\n",
    "- Handles broadcasting differently than `np.dot()` for higher dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Multiplication Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrix multiplication $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{A}$ has shape $(m, k)$\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{B}$ has shape $(k, n)$\n",
    "- Result $\\mathbf{C}$ has shape $(m, n)$\n",
    "- **Critical Rule**: Number of columns in $\\mathbf{A}$ must equal number of rows in $\\mathbf{B}$\n",

    "## Scikit-learn: Linear Regression with Closed-Form Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides the [`LinearRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) class, which implements a **closed-form solution** for linear regression using the **Normal Equation**. This approach computes the optimal weights directly through matrix algebra, without requiring iterative optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation: The Normal Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The closed-form solution derives from calculus by setting the gradient of the cost function to zero and solving for $\\mathbf{w}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **No iterations required** - Computes optimal weights in one step\n",
    "- ✅ **No learning rate needed** - No hyperparameters to tune\n",
    "- ✅ **Exact solution** - Finds global minimum directly (no convergence issues)\n",
    "- ✅ **No feature scaling required** - Works with raw features\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Closed-Form vs. Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Closed-Form Solution | Gradient Descent |\n",
    "|--------|---------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Dataset Size** | Small to medium (< 10,000 examples) | Large datasets (millions of examples) |\n",
    "| **Computation** | $O(n^3)$ due to matrix inversion | $O(kn)$ where k = iterations |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Fast for small $n$ | Faster for large $n$ |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Poor - requires inverting $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ | Excellent - iterative updates |\n",
    "| **Feature Scaling** | **Not required** ✓ | Required for good performance |\n",
    "| **Hyperparameters** | None | Learning rate, iterations |\n",
    "| **Convergence** | Always finds exact solution | May need tuning for convergence |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Computational Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix Inversion Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Normal Equation requires computing $(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}$\n",
    "- For $n$ features, this is an $(n \\times n)$ matrix\n",
    "- Matrix inversion has computational complexity of $O(n^3)$\n",
    "- **Becomes impractical when $n > 10,000$ features**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Must store $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ matrix in memory\n",
    "- For 10,000 features: $(10^4)^2 = 100$ million elements\n",
    "- Can cause memory issues on large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Closed-Form Solution Works Best\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Ideal Scenarios:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small to medium datasets (like our house price example)\n",
    "- Number of features < 1,000\n",
    "- Need quick, exact solution without tuning\n",
    "- Educational purposes to understand optimal parameters\n",
    "- Baseline model for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Avoid When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large datasets (> 100,000 examples)\n",
    "- High-dimensional data (> 10,000 features)\n",
    "- Real-time or streaming data scenarios\n",
    "- Computational resources are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note on Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **The closed-form solution does NOT require feature normalization.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Unlike gradient descent, which converges faster with normalized features, the Normal Equation produces the same optimal weights regardless of feature scales. This is because it solves the optimization problem algebraically rather than iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation in Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In Task 6 below, you'll use `LinearRegression` to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit the model using the Normal Equation\n",
    "2. Extract learned parameters (bias and weights)\n",
    "3. Compare results with your gradient descent implementation\n",
    "4. Verify that different methods converge to the same solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights learned from `LinearRegression` should be very close to those from your gradient descent implementation, validating both approaches!"

    "### Overview\n",

    "Scikit-learn provides the [`SGDRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html) class, which implements **Stochastic Gradient Descent** for linear regression. Unlike batch gradient descent (which uses all training examples in each iteration) or the closed-form solution (which requires expensive matrix inversion), SGD updates weights using **one or a few examples at a time**, making it highly scalable for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Stochastic Gradient Descent?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Gradient Descent** (what you implemented):\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} := \\mathbf{w} - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\nabla J^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **all** $m$ training examples per update\n",
    "- Smooth, consistent convergence\n",
    "- Computationally expensive for large datasets\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\mathbf{w} := \\mathbf{w} - \\alpha \\nabla J^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **one** randomly selected example per update\n",
    "- Much faster iterations\n",
    "- Noisy convergence path, but reaches good solution quickly\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Uses **small batch** of $b$ examples per update (e.g., $b = 32, 64, 128$)\n",
    "- Balances speed and stability\n",
    "- Best of both worlds for most applications\n",
    "\n",

    "|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| **Examples per Update** | All $m$ examples | 1 or small batch ($b$) |\n",

    "| **Final Accuracy** | Exact minimum | Close to minimum (with tuning) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Feature Scaling is Critical for SGD\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **The SGD solution performs best with normalized inputs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: SGD uses a **single learning rate** $\\alpha$ for all features. Without scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features with large ranges (e.g., house size: 500-5000 sqft) cause large gradients\n",
    "- Features with small ranges (e.g., bedrooms: 1-5) cause small gradients\n",
    "- One learning rate cannot work well for both → slow or unstable convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All features have similar ranges (typically mean=0, std=1)\n",
    "- Gradients are balanced across all features\n",
    "- Learning rate works uniformly → **fast, stable convergence** ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# StandardScaler: (x - mean) / std_dev → mean=0, std=1\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use SGD vs. Other Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use SGD When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large datasets** (> 100,000 examples)\n",
    "- **Online/streaming data** (model updates as new data arrives)\n",
    "- **Limited memory** (cannot load entire dataset)\n",
    "- **High-dimensional data** (many features)\n",
    "- **Quick approximate solution** needed\n",
    "- **Scalability** is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Avoid SGD When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small datasets (< 1,000 examples) → use closed-form solution\n",
    "- Need exact solution → use Normal Equation\n",
    "- Cannot scale features properly\n",
    "- Convergence stability is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "### SGD in Practice: Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Large-Scale Machine Learning**\n",

    "##  Making Predictions: Applying Your Trained Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of any machine learning model is to **make accurate predictions on new, unseen data**. In this final task, you'll use all three trained models to predict house prices for a new property, demonstrating the complete end-to-end machine learning workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Prediction Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**New House Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size**: 1,650 sqft\n",
    "- **Bedrooms**: 3\n",
    "- **Floors**: 2\n",
    "- **Age**: 20 years old\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task:** Predict the price using all three models and compare the results.\n",

    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a new example $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{new}}$, the prediction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_{\\text{new}} = \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{new}} = b + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + w_4 x_4$$\n",

    "prediction = model.predict(x_new_scaled)  # Correct prediction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Scaling Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your models were trained on **scaled features** (mean=0, std=1)\n",
    "- New data must be transformed using the **same scaling parameters**\n",
    "- Use `scaler.transform()` (NOT `fit_transform()`) on new data\n",
